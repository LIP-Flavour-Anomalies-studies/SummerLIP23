(A) Random features                   1-used All                       2-removed kstTrk(+)     
dataset 1-2 (80/20 split)             3-removed DCA                    4-removed DCA, tagB0     
dataset 3-8 (70/30 split)             5-removed cosAlpha, mu2, tagB0   6-removed Pts, cosAlpha         
signalWeight     = 1.0                7-removed bLBS, bVtxCL           8-removed bLBS, bVtxCL, kstarPts
backgroundWeight = 1.0

(B) Random features
dataset 9-16 (70/30 split)
#signalWeight     = 0.6774
#backgroundWeight = 0.8138

(C) Removed the input features one by one to test their influence in the BDT score
Best features: bLBS, bVtxCL, kstTrkmPt, kstTrkpPt, tagB0
Worst features: bCosAlphaBS, kstTrkmDCABS, kstTrkpDCABS, mu1Pt, mu2Pt
dataset 01-010 (80/20 split)
signalWeight = 1.0
backgroundWeight = 1.0

(D) Afterwards removed the worst input features of step C
Result: The best score was the one that contained more input features
dataset 100-101 (70/30 split)
signalWeight = 1.0
backgroundWeight = 1.0

(E)
Norm1 80/20
Norm1A 60/40
Norm1B 50/50
Norm1C 70/30

(Final)
Chosen dataset: Norm1C with 70/30 split; 250 trees, 2.5% nodeSize, 5 depth, 30 cuts
